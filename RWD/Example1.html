    <h3>RWD Example by Dhanshree Hood & Vijayalaxmi Yelchalwar</h3>
    <p id="main_content">  
        Responsive Web Design (RWD) is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the
        user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a mix
        of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from
        their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and
        scripting abilities. In other words, the website should have the technology to automatically respond to the
        user’s preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different design and development phase for each new
        gadget on the market.[1]
